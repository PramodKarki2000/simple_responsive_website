      In mathematics, a random walk is a mathematical object, known as a
      stochastic or random process, that describes a path that consists of a
      succession of random steps on some mathematical space such as the
      integers. An elementary example of a random walk is the random walk on the
      integer number line, {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }\mathbb {Z} , which
      starts at 0 and at each step moves +1 or −1 with equal probability. Other
      examples include the path traced by a molecule as it travels in a liquid
      or a gas (see Brownian motion), the search path of a foraging animal, the
      price of a fluctuating stock and the financial status of a gambler: all
      can be approximated by random walk models, even though they may not be
      truly random in reality. As illustrated by those examples, random walks
      have applications to engineering and many scientific fields including
      ecology, psychology, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology,
      economics, and sociology. Random walks explain the observed behaviors of
      many processes in these fields, and thus serve as a fundamental model for
      the recorded stochastic activity. As a more mathematical application, the
      value of π can be approximated by the use of a random walk in an
      agent-based modeling environment.[1][2] The term random walk was first
      introduced by Karl Pearson in 1905.[3] Various types of random walks are
      of interest, which can differ in several ways. The term itself most often
      refers to a special category of Markov chains, but many time-dependent
      processes are referred to as random walks, with a modifier indicating
      their specific properties. Random walks (Markov or not) can also take
      place on a variety of spaces: commonly studied ones include graphs, others
      on the integers or the real line, in the plane or higher-dimensional
      vector spaces, on curved surfaces or higher-dimensional Riemannian
      manifolds, and also on groups finite, finitely generated or Lie. The time
      parameter can also be manipulated. In the simplest context the walk is in
      discrete time, that is a sequence of random variables (X t) = (X 1, X 2,
      ...) indexed by the natural numbers. However, it is also possible to
      define random walks which take their steps at random times, and in that
      case, the position X t has to be defined for all times t ∈ [0,+∞).
      Specific cases or limits of random walks include the Lévy flight and
      diffusion models such as Brownian motion. Random walks are a fundamental
      topic in discussions of Markov processes. Their mathematical study has
      been extensive. Several properties, including dispersal distributions,
      first-passage or hitting times, encounter rates, recurrence or transience,
      have been introduced to quantify their behavior.
